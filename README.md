# Selective social interactions and speed-induced leadership in schooling fish

This repository includes code to run the models and reproduce the figures from the research article:

> Puy, A., Gimeno, E., Torrents, J., Bartashevich, P., Miguel, M. C., Pastor-Satorras, R., & Romanczuk, P. (2024). Selective social interactions and speed-induced leadership in schooling fish. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 121(18), e2309733121.

Dependencies: Numpy, Scipy, [Rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich), Latex font.

Files:

- ```simulations.ipynb```: jupyter notebook with the code.

- ```alignmentMap_nn_N=39.npy```: data of the experimental alignment force map used for simulations of the Explicit anti-alignment model.

To run the code and obtain the output figures, it is necessary to create in the same directory the folders: `alig_Nn`, `atracRep_Nn`, and `sim`.
